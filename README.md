Project Proposal: IoT System for Air Pollution Monitoring 

1.	Introduction 

This project proposes the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system for monitoring air pollution. The system will utilize a NodeMCU microcontroller, Arduino Uno, and various sensors to collect real-time air quality data. The collected data will be uploaded to a cloud platform for remote access and visualization. 

2.	Project Idea 

The project aims to create a portable air quality monitoring system that can be deployed in various locations. Users can remotely access and analyze the collected data to understand air quality variations. This information can be used for environmental research, personal health awareness, and pollution control efforts. 
3.  Project Objectives 
1.	Design and build an IoT system for air pollution monitoring.
2.	Integrate sensors (MQ135, MQ7, DHT22) to measure air quality parameters (CO2, CO, NH3, Ozone, Temperature, and Humidity). 
3.	Utilize a NodeMCU microcontroller for data processing and communication.
4.	Upload collected air quality data to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak, Adafruit IO, Blynk).
5.	 Develop a user interface for remote data visualization and access.

5. Problem Statement
   
Rwanda faces a growing challenge with air pollution, particularly in urban areas. While some efforts are underway, such as the national tree planting initiative and a ban on single-use plastics, a lack of widespread air quality monitoring hinders effective pollution control strategies and public health awareness.

This project proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) system for real-time air quality monitoring that can be deployed in various locations across Rwanda. This will address the following key issues:

1. Limited Data: Existing air quality monitoring in Rwanda is limited, making it difficult to assess the full scope of the problem and identify areas with the most significant pollution levels.
2. Public Awareness: Lack of real-time air quality data makes it difficult for citizens to understand air quality variations and take steps to protect their health, especially for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.
3. Targeted Interventions: Without detailed air quality data, it's challenging to pinpoint the sources of pollution and develop targeted interventions for mitigation.

This project's portable and cost-effective IoT system can address these problems by providing:

1.  Dense Monitoring Network: The ability to deploy the system in various locations will create a denser air quality monitoring network, offering a more comprehensive picture of Rwanda's air pollution.
2.  Real-time Data: The system will provide real-time data on key pollutants, allowing citizens to make informed decisions about their health and activities.
3.  Data-driven Solutions: The collected data can be used to identify pollution hotspots and inform the development of targeted policies and interventions to improve air quality in Rwanda.

5.  Project Timeline 
Day 1:
1. Research and finalize sensor selection based on target pollutants. 
2. Familiarize with NodeMCU and the chosen cloud platform.

Day 4: 
1.	System testing and refinement. 
       Day 5
1. Prepare project documentation and presentation. 

Note: This is a rough timeline and may be adjusted based on project complexity and unforeseen challenges. 

6.  Introduction to Project Documentation 

Detailed project documentation will be maintained throughout the development process. This documentation will include: 
1. Project proposal outlining objectives, requirements, and timeline. 
2. Circuit schematics for sensor and module connections. 
3. Arduino code with explanations and comments. 
4. Cloud platform configuration details. 
5. Project testing results and troubleshooting steps (if applicable). 

 7.  Conclusion 

This project provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with IoT technology and air pollution monitoring. By successfully building this system, we can contribute to a better understanding of air quality variations and potentially contribute to environmental protection efforts.
